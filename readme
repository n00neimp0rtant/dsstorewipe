usage: dsstorewipe /directory/path/

cleans out the given directory and all subdirectories of those pesky .DS_Store files. you can pass in as many separate paths as you like. if you don't pass any, it will just use the working directory.

if you build .debs on your mac, this is an excellent tool. stray .DS_Stores in a .deb can cause all kinds of problems, even breaking installation entirely.

oh and don't be a jerk and try to crash it. just be gentle. nice and easy

(for maximum effectiveness, drop this manly binary into /etc/bin)
